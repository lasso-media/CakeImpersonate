# Impersonate Component
A component that stores the current authentication session and creates new session for impersonating Users. User can revert back to original authentication sessions without the need to re-login.

## Warning
Always double check that an attacker cannot "spoof" other users in the controller actions. To prevent hijacking of users accounts that the current request User shouldn't/wouldn't have normal access to. You should enable [CsfrComponent](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/components/csrf.html) and [SecurityComponent](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/components/security.html) in your Controller when loading this component.

***This Plugin does circumvent default authentication mechanisms***

## Requirement
1. CakePHP 4.x

## Installation/Upgrading
`
composer require jomweb/cake-impersonate:"^3.0"
`

### Plugin Load
Open \src\Application.php add
```php
$this->addPlugin('CakeImpersonate');
```
to your bootstrap() method or call `bin/cake plugin load CakeImpersonate`

### Component Load
Load the component from controller
```php
$this->loadComponent('CakeImpersonate.Impersonate'); 
```

### Configure Session Key
Open `configure\app.php` and add
```php
'Impersonate' => [
    'sessionKey' => 'OriginalAuth'
]

```
to the `return [];` or use `Configure::write('Impersonate.sessionKey', 'OriginalAuth');` when loading the component.

## Usage
### Impersonate user
This requires the request to be a `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` so it can be protected by `SecurityComponent` and `CsrfComponent`
```php
$this->Impersonate->login($userIdToImpersonate);
```

### Check current user is impersonated
```php
$this->Impersonate->isImpersonated();
```

### Logout from impersonating
```php
$this->Impersonate->logout();
```
